# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects.

## Projects

### 1. CNN - Handwritten Digit Recognition (`cnn/`)

A desktop application that recognizes handwritten digits. It features a GUI built with PySide6 where users can draw a digit, which is then classified by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

### 2. Connect 4 AI Agents (`connect_4_agent/`)

An implementation of various AI agents to play Connect 4. This project includes a `gymnasium`-compatible game environment and features agents using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). You can play against the agents or have them compete against each other.

### 3. Deep Q-Learning (`deep-q-learning/`)

A project focused on reinforcement learning, specifically implementing a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm. The `env.py` file sets up the environment for this task.
